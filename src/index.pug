    p(class="mt1-xs") At Broadway, we take pride in our quality repairs. We fix bicycles expertly, from minor repairs, flats, and adjustments to package deals such as tune-ups and overhauls. We love what we do, so you can be sure that we’ll fix your bike better than anyone. All of our repairs go through a full double safety check. We always test ride your bike before we give it the thumbs up to make sure your bike is safe and performing as it should! 
    p No appointment necessary—just bring your bike in and we can give you a free estimate. You can leave the bike with us, or schedule a more convenient time.

      p We’re a worker-owned and operated cooperative in operation for 40+ years. To quote our friends at Equal Exchange “a worker cooperative is an alternative for-profit structure based upon standard democratic principles. It is not designed to maximize profits, nor returns to investors, but rather to bring to the workplace many of the rights and responsibilities that we hold as citizens in our communities. These principles include one-person/one-vote equality; open access to information (i.e., open-book management); free speech; and the equitable distribution of resources (such as income).”  Because of this we adhere to the 7 Cooperative Principles which includes upholding worker rights and participating in our community for the better.
      p We are proud to offer a minimum wage of $15 per hour and health insurance for full time workers. 
      p Walking into a bicycle shop for the first time can be an intimidating endeavor for many, which is why Broadway strives to create a welcoming environment for all persons that come through our door.
