      p When you choose Broadway Bicycle for maintenance, fixes, or builds, you’re getting 45 years of experience fixing and building.
      p Every job we do—from fixing a flat to a full tune up—is double checked by a second mechanic. In addition, we test ride your bike two times: both the mechanic and a test rider who looks the work over take your bike for a ride before we hand it back to you.
      p Additionally, you are supporting an environmentally conscious community space that actively promotes diversity in the biking community, values empowerment through education, and supports social justice work in the Boston area.

      p If you have your heart set on a custom set of wheels – let us build them for you! Do you long for a 700c wheel laced to a 3speed hub?
      p Are you planning a tour and want a bombproof adventure? We will help you select your components (hubs, spokes, rims) and then professionally assemble them for you.
