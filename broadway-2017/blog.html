  <h2>Ride Report: Bike Touring in Washington State</h2>
  <p class="footnote">Posted June 9th, 2017</p>
  <p id="docs-internal-guid-a86874bf-b11f-e1f4-09f7-ca171f3c89a0">Ellen here, writing in with a report on the first few days of a <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/pacific-coast/">Pacific Coast</a> bike tour! Erica and I spent the first few days of our tour in
    Washington state (Seattle to Portland, which is a common randonneuring route in that part of the country). It’s funny how working in a bike shop make you see the trees but not the forest &#8211; I am so used to being critical of uneven brake tension,
    poorly adjusted shifting, and finding that weird rattling sound from the bottom bracket, that I forgot for a second that I got into bikes because I like to ride them. It’s good to be reminded to see the forest, both the figurative forest of riding
    bikes and the literal Pacific Coast rainforests that are gracing our eyeballs for the first time. Taking a month to ride from Seattle to San Diego is definitely going to do the trick.</p>

  <p>For the weeks leading up to the departure date in early May, Erica and I had a lot of preparing to do. This was our first tour longer than 3 days, and we decided to go for 30. There will be another blog post with our gear list and setup and patterns
    for how we made our own stuff. But, suffice to say we had a lot of projects to do. Erica got a new bike for her 30th birthday (a Space Horse Disc! Custom painted!), and we barely had any gear storage space, so we had to make a lot of our gear from
    scratch or modify it heavily to fit what we wanted. Get excited for that list, we got reeeal DIY crafty to make it all.</p>

  <em>My 49cm / 700c Soma Double Cross and Erica&#8217;s 46cm / 650b Space Horse Disc</em>

  <p>The night before our flight, Erica and I and our friend disassembled our bikes in our living room. This is something I’ve done a million times at the shop. You can pick up a cardboard bike box and packing material for free at Broadway if you let us
    know ahead of time, or you can drop your bike off at the shop, and the mechanics will pack it for you for $60. We’ll also ship it right from the shop for an extra $10 labor. If you book your shipping through Bike Flights, it’s usually a little cheaper
    than the cheapest rate on FedEx Ground if you give it enough time. Read <a href="http://broadwaybicycleschool.com/news/how-to-travel-with-your-bike-this-summer/">more tips about traveling with your bike</a> in my last post.</p>


  <p>Without the use of bike stands, the packing took roughly two hours, during which we padded all the tubing, took off the front wheel and pedals, removed the racks and fenders, twisted the fork around, took of the handlebars, and stuffed sleeping bags,
    panniers, and rain gear into the boxes alongside the bikes. JetBlue has a max weight allowance of 100lbs, and even with all that gear we maxed out at a 55lb box each. Not bad! Next time we’ll throw some extra wrenches in there.</p>

  <p>Off to the airport we went, where we landed at our start point for the trip: Seattle!</p>

  <h3>Day 0: Boston to Seattle: 0 miles biked, 2,492 miles flown</h3>

  <img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jNsaZX5XyupEGH47oPszUHD7caHxZhQxueM5MKPaqfLhj0MG8XGBQv4CFkL35c7Ch6FO2-iQyR1ZPWXQ21iFzv9UE-s3RV8tkIaZnUC2WwAB7M0EkNyPUHwSzDcq7NEEHDrVve4n" width="624" height="469" /></p>

  <ul class="">
    <li>Worst part: Waking up at 4am, and writing “This Side Up” and “Fragile” all over the boxes then watching them get tossed on their sides the second they went on the carousel. Seeing this carelessness in person, I can only imagine what happens behind
      the walls of the baggage area, or in the shipping terminals of FedEx. I’ve unpacked bikes that have been shipped to the shop that have dents in the frame, bent fenders, wheels out of true, and all sorts of problems because of bad packaging coupled
      with bad handling. Broadway takes a lot of care to package everything that could break, and in the moment I saw my bike get tossed roughly onto the conveyor belt, I was thankful for that training.</li>
    <li>Best part: Getting picked up by my cousin in Seattle who kindly let us explode the boxes in her driveway, reassemble the bikes, and repack our panniers with assistance of her curious black lab, Maddy. Have you wondered why there are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/broadwaybikes/">so many dog photos on Broadway&#8217;s Instagram</a>?
      That&#8217;s partly my doing. I&#8217;m a critter fiend.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Day 1: Seattle to Rochester, WA: 66 miles biked, 36 miles by bus.</h3>

  <img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TadYMT3sbhQ5a2DrFyC6pBMDjcdLNzfXdOyKuldjD4pVGeMIMxw5W0q-RBu4NRJJx7jAskoEZNu8DDvta-UFepAc1O0jp2do0wMFtc8hPjjrrpFt0lh-409WeN1rC9j3UE5GdIUJ" width="624" height="468" />

  <ul class="list--indented">
    <li>Best part: Settling into the ride and seeing West Coast vegetation for the first time. It’s all so LUSH out here! We started off the day with a 2-mile long downhill, and carried a 16 mph pace all the way through Tacoma and Olympia because of the thrill,
      energy, and a nice tailwind. And, Erica and I quickly solved our long-standing pacing issue: Erica is extremely strong and fast, and I average 10mph with all my birdwatching and rockspotting. So, to even us out, Erica graciously offered to carry
      ? if the weight. It worked! We felt strong, and the nerves of getting started on something big quickly settled into a hum of enjoying each moment of the ride.</li>
    <li>Worst part: Getting skunked on a snack run. We realized we could stop at Costco along the way for free samples as mid-ride snacks. But, it was a Monday, so sadly there were none out and instead we soothed our disappointment by buying enough granola
      bars and dried fruit to last us for weeks. This extra weight turned out to be a big mistake in the long run, we carried about 1lb of extra, not-very-good snacks on us at all times. The lesson after this was only buy what your body will be delighted
      to eat: food that will give you energy, lift your spirits, and make you poop.</li>
    <li>Mechanics: Erica started getting a pain in her right tricep, which she suspected was from too short of a reach. We decided to give it another day to see if her tricep just needed to strengthen up.</li>
    <li>Lodging: That night we stayed with our very first <a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/">Warm Showers</a> host. Warm Showers is like Couchsurfing and AirBnB, where it lets everyday people open up their homes (for free!) to touring cyclists who just
      need a place to sleep and a warm shower. Our host John was a Seattle-area randonneuring junkie who knows Jan Heine and all the geeks from the internet. He cooked us noodles, and we stayed up late chatting before we retired to our hammock, which
      we set up in his backyard in a field of dandelions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Day 2: Rochester to Castle Rock, WA: Biked 51 miles</h3>

  <h2>Pride Cookie Sale this Saturday, June 10th!</h2>

  <p>We are so proud to support and celebrate our LGBTQIA community members! This weekend is Pride Weekend in Boston, and to give back to the community we are hosting a cookie sale all day on Saturday June 10th at the shop. We’re open from 10am to 6pm, and
    all cookies must go!</p>

    Last year, we raised enough money to buy two of their youth bikes complete with helmets, locks, and lights. All that thanks to the generosity and support of our incredible community members giving back. Come back again on Saturday to celebrate with
    us this year!</p>
