      <p>When you choose Broadway Bicycle for maintenance, fixes, or builds, you’re getting 45 years of experience fixing and building.</p>
      <p>Every job we do—from fixing a flat to a full tune up—is double checked by a second mechanic. In addition, we test ride your bike two times: both the mechanic and a test rider who looks the work over take your bike for a ride before we hand it back
        to you.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you are supporting an environmentally conscious community space that actively promotes diversity in the biking community, values empowerment through education, and supports social justice work in the Boston area.</p>

      <h2>Custom Wheel Building</h2>
      <p>If you have your heart set on a custom set of wheels – let us build them for you! Do you long for a 700c wheel laced to a 3speed hub?</p>
      <p>Are you planning a tour and want a bombproof adventure? We will help you select your components (hubs, spokes, rims) and then professionally assemble them for you. Labor is $78.00 if you bring in your own parts, and $60 if you purchase your parts
        with us (parts cost additional). All handbuilt wheels come with a 30 day check-up and a 1 year warranty.</p>
